#Contacts-App
> Following a tutorial by Antonio Sarossi.

**How to make it work?**
> 1st Step: 
> 
Go to: `www.apachefriends.org/` to download and install XAMPP on your computer.

> 2nd Step: 
> 
On the installer, you only need to select to install the following components:
<ul>
  <li>Apache</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
</ul>

> 3rd Step: 
> 
Open XAMPP Control Panel and make sure that you keep Apache and MySQL running while you open Contacts-App. To make them run, just press start on both of them.

> 4th Step: 
> 
Now move the folder of Contacts-App inside of /xampp/htdocs/.

> 5th Step 
> 
Now you have all settled down, for opening the Contacts-App App, you have to type this on your browser: `localhost/contacts-app/`. If you did everything correctly, that should work.
