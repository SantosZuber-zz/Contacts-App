# Contacts-App
*Following a tutorial by Antonio Sarossi.*

**How to make it work?**
<ul>
  <li>Downloading and installing the components:</li>

> 1st Step: 
> 
Go to: `www.apachefriends.org/` to download and install XAMPP on your computer.

> 2nd Step: 
> 
On the installer, you only need to select to install the following components:
<ul>
  <li>Apache</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
</ul>

> 3rd Step: 
> 
Once you have already installed it, open XAMPP Control Panel and make sure that you keep Apache and MySQL running while you are using Contacts-App. To make them run, just press start on both of them.

> 4th Step: 
> 
Now download the repository of Contacts-App, rename it to contacts-app and then move the folder to /xampp/htdocs/.
</ul>







Now that you have all settled down, to open the Contacts-App App, you have to type this on your browser: `localhost/contacts-app/`. If you did everything correctly, that should work.
